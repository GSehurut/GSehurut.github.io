    <h2>The Man Behind the Computer</h2>
    <p>
      Passionate about working with numbers and driven by the thrill of
      programming, I’ve recently developed an intense interest in coding.
      Currently juggling multiple programming languages, including
      <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java,</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, I
      find joy in the challenge and creativity that comes with each line of
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I’m learning many languages at once (not sure if that was the
      wisest choice!), the excitement and satisfaction make it worthwhile. Every
      day is a new adventure in the world of tech!

<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
<p>
  Originally from <strong>Botswana</strong>, a country located at the heart of
  Southern Africa, I’m proud to call this place home. The natural beauty here is
  simply breathtaking, and there’s no place like it. Whether it’s the vast
  desert landscapes or the lush Okavango Delta, Botswana has a charm that’s hard
  to match.

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>
  I’m oddly obsessed with pictures of coffee, even though I’m not a coffee
  drinker myself! Tea is my go-to choice, but I can’t help but be fascinated by
  the aesthetic appeal of coffee pictures. Here’s one for your enjoyment:
