          <h2>The Man Behind the Computer</h2>
          <p>
            Passionate about working with numbers and driven by the thrill of
            programming, I've recently developed an intense interest in coding.
            Currently juggling multiple programming languages, including
            <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java,</strong> and
            <strong>SQL</strong>, I find joy in the challenge and creativity
            that comes with each line of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I'm learning many languages at once (not sure if that was the
            wisest choice!), the excitement and satisfaction make it worthwhile.
            Every day is a new adventure in the world of tech!

          Originally from <strong>Botswana</strong>, a country located at the
          heart of Southern Africa, I'm proud to call this place home. The
          natural beauty here is simply breathtaking, and there's no place like
          it. Whether it's the vast desert landscapes or the lush Okavango
          Delta, Botswana has a charm that's hard to match.

          I'm oddly obsessed with pictures of coffee, even though I'm not a
          coffee drinker myself! Tea is my go-to choice, but I can't help but be
          fascinated by the aesthetic appeal of coffee pictures. Here's one for
          your enjoyment:
