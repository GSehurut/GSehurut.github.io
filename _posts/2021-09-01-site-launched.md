## The creation of the site itself as we know it 

Created a simple website using GitHub Pages with integrated Jekyll (note md files use Markdown for syntax formatting). **Bold** words. As Markdown is actually is a lot easier to use for writing posts/notes than raw HTML. This website was demostrated in class on the 7th of October 2021, going forward I intend to use it as my portfolio website for any project that wish to undertake especially with regards to sofware engineering and web programming.
