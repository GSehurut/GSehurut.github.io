## Yet another post that I thought about.

I have been thoroughly enjoying my _web programming_ module, it literally gives me a chance to create something from nothing and manage that thing as it runs with the aim of consistently improving how it works and the like. For example here is a skeletal show of how one would usually do their HTML work;

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=
    , initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
